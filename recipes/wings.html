        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crispy chicken wings are a popular appetizer and game day 
            snack. They are made by deep-frying or baking chicken wings 
            until the skin is crispy and the meat is cooked through. 
            The wings are often tossed in a sauce or seasoning of some 
            kind before serving.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of the recipe, some common 
            methods include: marinating the wings in a mixture of 
            spices and sauces for added flavor, then deep-fry them or 
            bake them in the oven. The wings can also be coated in a 
            mixture of flour, cornstarch, and spices to create a crispy 
            texture. Some popular sauces include buffalo, BBQ, honey 
            mustard, and ranch. They are often served with a side of blue 
            cheese or ranch dressing for dipping. Crispy chicken wings 
            are a great option for parties, game day gatherings, or as a 
            casual meal.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 
                shallow baking dish with aluminum foil and grease 
                lightly.</li>
            <li>Cut tips from chicken wings and discard. Cut between 
                the joint to separate each wing into 2 pieces.</li>
            <li>Combine butter and garlic in a small saucepan over low 
                heat; heat until butter is melted and garlic is fragrant, 
                3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, parsley, oregano, paprika, salt, 
                and pepper together in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken wing pieces in melted butter mixture; coat 
                with Parmesan cheese mixture in the bowl. Arrange in the 
                prepared baking dish. Drizzle any remaining butter on 
                top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until skin is browned and 
                juices run clear, about 1 hour.</li>
