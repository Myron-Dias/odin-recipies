        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crispy chicken wings are a popular appetizer and game day 
            snack. They are made by deep-frying or baking chicken wings 
            until the skin is crispy and the meat is cooked through. 
            The wings are often tossed in a sauce or seasoning of some 
            kind before serving.</p>
        <p>There are many variations of the recipe, some common 
            methods include: marinating the wings in a mixture of 
            spices and sauces for added flavor, then deep-fry them or 
            bake them in the oven. The wings can also be coated in a 
            mixture of flour, cornstarch, and spices to create a crispy 
            texture. Some popular sauces include buffalo, BBQ, honey 
            mustard, and ranch. They are often served with a side of blue 
            cheese or ranch dressing for dipping. Crispy chicken wings 
            are a great option for parties, game day gatherings, or as a 
            casual meal.</p>
