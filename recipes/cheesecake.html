        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Strawberry cheesecake is a delicious and popular dessert 
            that typically consists of a graham cracker crust, a 
            creamy cheesecake filling, and a topping of fresh 
            strawberries. The crust is made from crushed graham crackers, 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cheesecake is usually baked in a water bath to ensure a 
            smooth, creamy texture, and is cooled to room temperature 
            before being refrigerated for at least a few hours to set. 
            The result is a rich and decadent dessert with a tangy cream 
            cheese filling, a sweet and crumbly crust, and the fresh, 
            juicy flavor of strawberries. It's perfect for any occasion 
            and it can be served with whipped cream or extra fresh 
            strawberries on top.
