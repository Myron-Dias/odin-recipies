        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Strawberry cheesecake is a delicious and popular dessert 
            that typically consists of a graham cracker crust, a 
            creamy cheesecake filling, and a topping of fresh 
            strawberries. The crust is made from crushed graham crackers, 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cheesecake is usually baked in a water bath to ensure a 
            smooth, creamy texture, and is cooled to room temperature 
            before being refrigerated for at least a few hours to set. 
            The result is a rich and decadent dessert with a tangy cream 
            cheese filling, a sweet and crumbly crust, and the fresh, 
            juicy flavor of strawberries. It's perfect for any occasion 
            and it can be served with whipped cream or extra fresh 
            strawberries on top.

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make crust:</strong> Combine graham cracker 
                crumbs, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a bowl; mix well. 
                Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch 
                springform pan. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 
                30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Make filling:</strong> Place strawberries and 
                cornstarch into a blender. Cover and puree until 
                smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a 
                boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick 
                and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry 
                sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for 
                serving.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric 
                mixer until light and fluffy; gradually beat in 
                condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, 
                then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; 
                drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 
                teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer. Carefully spoon 
                remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop 
                remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top. 
                Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl 
                strawberry sauce.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost 
                set, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a 
                knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 
                1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate 8 hours to 
                overnight before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If 
                sauce is too thick, stir in water.</li>
        </ol>
